# CACKD

CACKD is a [segmentation_models_pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch)-based framework that leverages Covariance Attention and Correlation Information Fusion for Knowledge Distillation, boosting semantic segmentation performance on lens flareâ€“degraded road scene images.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **smp-based**: Plug-and-play support for UNet, DeepLabV3+, etc.  
- **Channel Covariance Attention Module (CCAM)**: Captures second-order channel statistics to highlight robust features under varying flare conditions.  
- **Class-wise Cross-Correlation KD**: Distills a full CÃ—C correlation matrix of class activations, preserving inter-class relationships during training.  
- **Zero Inference Overhead**: All attention and distillation modules are active only during training; the Student model remains lightweight at inference.  
- **Synthetic Flare Dataset Compatibility**: Includes data loaders and augmentations tailored for Syn-flare CamVid and Syn-flare KITTI benchmarks.  
- **Built-in Grad-CAM Tools**: Multi-layer Grad-CAM scripts for visualizing how CCAM adjusts focus under flareâ€”ideal for debugging and paper figures.
